## Overview

This is a transaction simulator application built with a modern frontend stack including React, TypeScript, and Vite. It provides a user-friendly interface to simulate financial transactions between different accounts, view a dashboard with the latest transaction history, and monitor account balances. The UI was based on the dribbble design: https://dribbble.com/shots/24557172-Admin-Transaction-Ui

- `src/components`: Contains reusable UI components, organized into `atoms` and `molecules` based on Atomic Design principles.
- `src/context`: Holds React context providers for state management.
- `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for reusable logic.
- `src/icons`: SVG icons used throughout the application.
- `src/pages`: Top-level page components that correspond to different routes.
- `src/store`: State management logic (e.g., Zustand or Redux).
- `src/types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions.
- `src/utils`: Utility functions.

## 💡 Best Practices

- **TypeScript for Type Safety**: The entire codebase is written in TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.
- **Atomic Design**: Components are organized following Atomic Design principles (`atoms`, `molecules`) to promote reusability and scalability.
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic is extracted into custom hooks to keep components clean and maintainable.
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier are configured to enforce a consistent code style and catch potential errors early.
